(work in progress... )

Hello, welcome to another simple Todo list app!!!
This this a ReactJs study, made just to study and exercise some basic stuffs from React, like: 
- functional react components, hooks, shared State, prop drilling, Context, Atomic design pattern, integrations and so on...


# Stack and dependencies

 - Sass;

# About

## Runnig the app
After runnig the dev server using vite, you can open the local ip at your browser to get access to the app.

## Structure and features
The app itself is too simple, no fancy stuff. It consist of just a simple translucid card where you can register a new
To do activity, set the priority and add it to the to do's list.
The to do's list is behind that form card, where you can see all registered activities and do some actions as:
- check as done;
- delete a activity.

## Where are my data?
Your activities list, as well their infos, are stored at your browser's Local Storage. So every time that you return to 
the app you will have the restored to do list of activities, at least if you don't clear this local Storage data.

## Responsity, mobile and bigger devices
This app was made for big screens, but our team (just myself) are working hard (not so hard) to bring a better experence
from 320px screens and beyond that.
But not only layout's metter, some cool events will happen just on mouse events in actual version like hover event, So
to get a better experence try to running this at your desktop or notebook too.

## Cross browser compatiblity
This app as primary made with help of Firefox, but some corrections were made for Chrome. Both running versions released after 2021 will be fine, so is espected that it work on these browsers without any issues.
If you'r using another browser or older version, please contact me to give your feedback.
